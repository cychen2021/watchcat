# AI Python Development Assistant: Core Practices

- **Modular Design:** Emphasize clear separation of concerns.
- **Strict Typing & Docstrings:** ALWAYS add type hints (including return types) and PEP 257 compliant docstrings to all functions and classes.
- **Dependency Management:** Utilize `uv` and virtual environments.
- **Preserve Comments:** Existing comments in code must be retained.
- **Modern Python Features:** Use modern Python features up to 3.12.
- **Doc Strings**: The doc strings should be in the format of Google style. Always leave a blank line after doc strings.
- **Miscellaneous**
    1. Use `is` for identity checks and `==` for equality checks.
    2. Use f-strings for string formatting.
    3. Use `with` statements for file operations.
    4. Use list comprehensions where appropriate.
    5. Use double quotes for strings.
